array probs

// Create a function called 'reversedLooper' that when passed an array will loop through it backwards and subtract 2 from the last element, 1 from the second to last, 0 from to the third to last, add one to the fourth to last, add 2 to the fifth to last, etc. until it reaches the front of the array.  Return the list when you are done


	function reversedLooper(array) {
  var numToAdd = -2;
   		for (var i = array.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
          array[i]=array[i]+numToAdd;
          numToAdd++;
        }
        return array;
    }
